## Proxies

A proxy (variable) operationalizes a theoretical construct that cannot be easily observed and hence measured.
Commonly, a proxy does not directly reflect the construct itself but rather serves as an approximation.
A proxy is a valid reflection or approximation of the construct it is supposed to quantify if it exhibits high construct validity.


## Construct Validity

**Translation Validity:** Is the measure a good reflection/translation of the construct?
- *Face Validity:* Is the measure valid on ‘its face’, i.e., does it comply with intuition?
- *Content Validity:* Does the measure capture the conceptual meaning of the construct? This assessment requires a benchmark to be compared to and may encompass tests for internal (valid within-sample) and external validity (valid out-of-sample).

**Criteria-Related Validity:** Does the measure behave according to theory and the researchers' priors?
- *Convergent Validity:* Does the measure correlate with measures that are expected to capture related constructs?
- *Concurrent Validity:* Does the measure correlate with a behavior that is expected to occur with the measure?
- *Predicitve Validity:* Does the measure predict an outcome that is expected to result from the construct?
- *Discriminant Validity:* Is the measure independent from (i.e., exhibits a low correlation with) measures that are expected to capture something else?
