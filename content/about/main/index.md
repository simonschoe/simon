  I am a PhD student and Research Associate in Accounting at the University of MÃ¼nster. I am engaged in various [research projects](/research) that all share a common ground: **Data Science**. I strive to approach hard problems with a [scientific mindset](https://hbr.org/2022/05/act-like-a-scientist), favor deep work, and alternate between R and Python to harness the best of both worlds.
  
  My research investigates
  - how machine learning could aid managerial decision-makers in gauging accounting estimates,
  - how natural language processing could be leveraged to meter complex phenomenons in firms' capital market communications with financial analysts, and
  - how neural transfer learning could advance the state-of-the-art in textual analysis in Accounting Research.
  
  My tech stack includes [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for tabular data wrangling, [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for data visualisation, [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) for web scraping, [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/), [prodigy](https://prodi.gy/), and [spacy](https://spacy.io/) for NLP and data annotation, [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/), [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [DALEX](https://dalex.drwhy.ai/) for machine learning, [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) for deep learning, [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan), and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for literate coding, and [Git](https://git-scm.com/)+[GitHub](https://github.com/) for version control.
  
  Previously, I worked as an intern at Miele, BASF, and Bayer. I became acquainted with different facets of the Accounting & Finance function in international corporates.
