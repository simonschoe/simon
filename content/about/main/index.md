  The solution to many contemporary problems, big or small, begins with the question of *measurement*. My [research](/research) focuses broadly on measurement problems in accounting. These include the prediction of accounting estimates, the analysis of corporate narratives, and the estimation of plausibly causal effects. In my works, I pair traditional quantitative methods with novel techniques from machine learning, natural language processing, interpretable machine learning, and causal machine learning. I am driven by an intense curiosity and approach my work with a [scientific mindset](https://hbr.org/2022/05/act-like-a-scientist). I enjoy deep work and alternating between R and Python to harness the best of both worlds. 
  
  My research explores
  - how machine learning can help managers provide decision-useful accounting estimates and reduce human bias,
  - how natural language processing can be used to meter complex phenomena in firms' capital market communications with financial analysts, and
  - how transfer learning can advance the state-of-the-art in textual analysis in accounting research.
  
  My tech stack includes
  - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for tabular data wrangling,
  - [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for data visualization,
  - [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/), [Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) for web scraping,
  - [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html), [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/), [spacy](https://spacy.io/), and [LLMs](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) for NLP, 
  - [prodigy](https://prodi.gy/) for data annotation,
  - [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/), [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [DALEX](https://dalex.drwhy.ai/) for machine learning,
  - [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) for deep learning,
  - [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) for experiment tracking,
  - [fixest](https://lrberge.github.io/fixest/) and [did](https://bcallaway11.github.io/did/) for empirical modeling,
  - [DoubleML](https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/index.html) for causal machine learning,
