  Welcome to my website. I am a PhD student and Research Associate in Accounting at the University of MÃ¼nster. I am engaged in various research projects that all share a common ground: **Data Science**.
  
  In particular, I investigate
  - how machine learning could aid managerial decision-makers in gauging accounting estimates,
  - how natural language processing could be leveraged to meter complex and previously unmeasurable phenomenons in firms' capital market communications with financial analysts, and
  - how neural transfer learning could advance the state-of-the-art in textual analysis in Accounting Research.
  
  Previously, I worked as an intern at Miele, BASF, and Bayer. I became acquainted with different facets of the Accounting & Finance function in international corporates while wrangling operational data from prevalent accounting information systems using R and Tableau.
