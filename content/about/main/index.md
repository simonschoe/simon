  The solution of many contemporaneous problems, big or small, starts with the issue of *measurement*. My [research](/research) focuses broadly on measurement problems in accounting. These involve the prediction of accounting estimates, the analysis of corporate narratives, and the estimation of plausibly causal effects. In my works, I pair traditional quantitative methods with novel techniques from machine learning, natural language processing, interpretable machine learning, and causal machine learning. I am driven by an intense curiosity and approach my work with a [scientific mindset](https://hbr.org/2022/05/act-like-a-scientist). I enjoy deep work and frequently alternate between R and Python to harness the best of both worlds. 
  
  My research investigates
  - how machine learning could aid managers in providing decision-useful accounting estimates and reducing human biases,
  - how natural language processing could be leveraged to meter complex phenomenons in firms' capital market communications with financial analysts, and
  - how transfer learning could advance the state-of-the-art in textual analysis in accounting research.
