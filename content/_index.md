  I am a second-year PhD student intrigued by practical problems at the intersection between data science and accounting. As a teacher, I try to empower others to discover and embrace the merits of data and AI. As a researcher, I investigate how machine learning can promote managerial decision-making and aid in making complex phenomenons tangible.
