  I am a final year PhD student intrigued by practical problems at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and accounting. As an educator, I try to empower others to discover and embrace the merits of data and AI. As a researcher, I explore how machine learning can inform managerial decision-making and help make complex phenomena measurable.
