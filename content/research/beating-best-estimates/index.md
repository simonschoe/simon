title: "Beating 'Best Estimates': Machine Learning Predictions, Managerial Errors, and the Warranty Provision"
---

### Abstract

This study employs machine learning to shed light on the accuracy of discretionary accounting estimates and the causes of human estimation errors. Using proprietary data from a large European manufacturing firm, we train and evaluate a battery of different prediction models to gauge a particularly pervasive accounting estimate: the warranty provision. We find that machine learning models consistently outperform human experts when compared on the basis of individual warranty claims, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Importantly, this gap amplifies when estimates are aggregated across homogeneous classes of products, as prescribed by the regulator. Leveraging institutional knowledge about the mechanism by which experts generate estimates, we attribute the larger human errors to misspecifications of the managerial estimation model and discuss the effect of misaligned incentives on model choice. Overall, this work demonstrates how machine learning can facilitate the disclosure of high-quality accounting estimates in the presence of measurement uncertainty, managerial discretion, and potential human biases.
