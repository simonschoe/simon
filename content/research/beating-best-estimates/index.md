title: "Beating 'Best Estimates': Machine Learning Predictions, Managerial Errors, and the Warranty Provision"

### Abstract

This study employs machine learning to shed light on the accuracy of discretionary accounting estimates. Given their central role in financial reporting, the quality of these estimates is key to filers, auditors, and regulators alike. Using proprietary data by a large European manufacturing firm, we train and evaluate a battery of different prediction models on the task of estimating a particularly substantive accounting estimate: the warranty provision. We find that machine learning models consistently outperform human experts when compared on the basis of individual warranty claims, both in-sample and out-of-sample. This gap is amplified when estimates are aggregated and benchmarked per homogeneous class of items, as prescribed by the regulator. Leveraging institutional knowledge about the mechanism through which experts generate provision estimates, we can attribute the higher human errors to misspecifications of the managerial estimation model. Altogether, this work demonstrates how machine learning can facilitate the disclosure of high-quality accounting estimates in the presence of measurement uncertainty, managerial discretion, and potential human biases.
