### Abstract

Value-based (VB) management is an approach that seeks to align the interests of managers and shareholders by encouraging actions that maximize shareholder value. One possible approach to increase shareholder value is to optimize risk taking and the cost of capital. This paper focuses on rating changes that reflect credit risk. We use option pricing theory to analyze the effect of increased credit risk — as reflected by negative rating changes — on shareholder value. Increased credit risk can be the result of a higher cash flow variance, which affects the cost of debt, the cost of equity and shareholder value. By comparing capital market reactions to rating changes for users and non-users of VB performance measures, we investigate the shareholder value effect of using such measures. With a sample of 115 rating changes of listed German firms between 1996 and 2014, we separately analyze market reactions to downgrades and upgrades. We find that using VB performance metrics is positively associated with market reactions to downgrade announcements and thus with shareholder value. This indicates that VB measures lead to a risk-taking strategy that is in line with shareholders’ interests, and such measures reduce information asymmetries. Further, using VB metrics is not significantly associated with market reactions to upgrade announcements. This might be the result of lower information asymmetries in the context of upgrades.
