### Abstract

We propose a firm-level proxy of transformational change that can be readily derived from executives’ communications in earnings conference calls. The measure relies on the use of deep learning techniques, in particular large language models, which enable us to evaluate context in longer text sequences and, thus, to accurately detect language patterns indicative of a firm’s transformational change endeavors. We demonstrate that the measure (1) captures within-firm variation in transformational change, (2) correlates with conceptually related proxies, (3) predicts future resource allocations, (4) yields lower measurement error than alternative approaches for textual analysis, such as predefined wordlists, and (5) is perceived by market participants as a value-relevant signal of future cashflows.
